Hi! I'm Sangay, a passionate and detail-oriented Full-Stack Developer focused on building secure, intuitive, and meaningful digital experiences. I enjoy turning ideas into functional and beautifully designed products — from frontend interfaces to backend systems.

I’m committed to continuous learning, creative problem-solving, and taking ownership in everything I build. Currently sharpening my skills in modern full-stack technologies, responsive UI/UX, and secure development practices inspired by cybersecurity principles.
